2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews
...> JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = business_id
...> JOIN users ON user_id = users.id
...> WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id
...> AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews
...> JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = business_id
...> JOIN users ON users.id = user_id
...> WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id
...> AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

OUTPUT WHEN WE ASK FOR SELECT INFORMATION
sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews
...> JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = business_id
...> JOIN users ON users.id = user_id
...> WHERE reviews.business_id = 1;
