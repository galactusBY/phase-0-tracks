# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the ability to create branches of a master file in order to make changes without changing the original file. This is useful because you are able to make changes without tainting the original code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a parallel copy of an original file. You can use a branch to make edits which can later be merged into the master file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for a branch. A good commit message is one that sums up an edit with brevity.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when there is an inability to reconcile a branch with the master.
