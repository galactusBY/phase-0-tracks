// Release 0
// split array in parts
// add up the letters in each part of the array value
// create a method that will compare those values and return that which has the longest amount of chars and gives it as the longest word/phrase

// Release 1
// Split all hash key values and put them into an array
// split all hash values and put them into an array
// compare each value in the key array with a true or false result
// compare each value in the value array with a true or false result
// print the comparison results as a true or false statement
// possibly print the result to a string for the user to statement

// Release 2
// // Create a method that will take an integer and give back a random series of word that is the same length as that integer's value.
// Max chars length of 10 and Min of 1
// create method that takes integer as an argument
// use a random letter generator to populate the chars in a word
// send that completed word to an array
// find a way to randomly generate a number between 1-10 and feed that into the method for creating a random word.
